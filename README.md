### Ichimoku Fractal Flow 
By Gurjit Singh

Ichimoku Fractal Flow distills the Ichimoku system into a single oscillator by merging fractal echoes of price and cloud dynamics into one flow signal. Instead of static Ichimoku lines, it measures the "flow" between Conversion/Base, Span A/B, price echoes, and cloud echoes. The result is a multidimensional oscillator that reveals hidden rhythm, momentum shifts, and trend bias.

#### 📌 Key Features
1. Fourfold Fusion – The oscillator blends:
   * Phase: Tenkan vs. Kijun spread (short vs. medium trend).
   * Kumo Phase: Span A vs. Span B spread (cloud thickness).
   * Echo: Price vs lagged reflection.
   * Cloud Echo: Price vs. projected cloud center.
2. Oscillator Output – A unified flow line oscillating around zero.
3. Dual Calculation Modes – Oscillator can be built using:
   * High-Low Midpoint (classic Ichimoku-style averaging).
   * Wilder’s RMA (smoother, less noisy averaging averaging).
4. Optional Smoothing – EMA or Wilder’s RMA creates a trend line, enabling MACD-style crossovers.  
5. Dynamic Coloring – Bullish/Bearish color shifts for quick bias recognition.
6. Fill Styling – Highlighted regions between oscillator & smoothing line.
7. Zero Line Reference – Acts as a structural pivot (bull vs. bear).

#### 🔑 How to Use
1. Add to Chart: Works across all assets and timeframes.  
2. Flow Bias (Zero Line):
   * Above 0 → Bullish flow 🐂
   * Below 0 → Bearish flow 🐻
3. With Signal Line:
   * Oscillator above smoothing line → Possible upward trend shift. 
   * Oscillator below smoothing line → Possible downward trend shift.  
4. Strength:
   * Wide separation from smoothing = strong trend.
   * Flat, tight clustering = indecision/range.
5. Contextual Edge: Combine signals with Ichimoku Cloud analysis for stronger confluence.  

#### ⚙️ Inputs & Options
* Conversion Line (Tenkan, default 9)
* Base Line (Kijun, default 26)
* Leading Span B (default 52)
* Lag/Lead Shift (default 26)
* Oscillator Mode: High-Low Midpoint vs Wilder’s RMA
* Use Smoothing (toggle on/off)
* Signal Smoothing: Wilder/EMA option  
* Smoothing Length (default 9)
* Bullish/Bearish Colors + Transparency

#### 💡 Tips
* Wilder’s RMA (both oscillator & smoothing) is gentler, reducing whipsaws in sideways markets.
* High-Low Mid captures pure Ichimoku-style ranges, good for structure-based traders.  
* EMA reacts faster than RMA; use if you want early momentum signals.  
* Zero-line flips act like momentum pivots—watch them near cloud boundaries.  
* Signal line crossovers behave like MACD-style triggers.  
* Strongest signals appear when oscillator, signal line, and Ichimoku Cloud all align.  

👉 In short: Ichimoku Fractal Flow compresses multi-layered Ichimoku system into a single fractal oscillator that detects flow, pivotal shifts, and momentum with clarity—bridging price, cloud, and echoes into one signal. Where the cloud shows structure, IFF reveals the underlying flow. Together, they offer a fractal lens into market rhythm.
