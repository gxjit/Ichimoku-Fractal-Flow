# Ichimoku-Fractal-Flow
Ichimoku Fractal Flow distills the Ichimoku system into a single oscillator by merging fractal echoes of price and cloud dynamics into one flow signal. Instead of static Ichimoku lines, it measures the "flow" between Conversion/Base, Span A/B, price echoes, and cloud echoes.
